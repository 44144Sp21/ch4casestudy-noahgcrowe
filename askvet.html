            <dt class="category"> Our dog, Sparky, likes to eat whatever the kids are snacking on. Is it OK for the dog to eat chocolate?</dt>
            <dd>Chocolate is toxic to dogs. Please do not feed your dog chocolate. Try playing a game with your children&#95;when you feed them people treats, they can feed Sparky dog treats.</dd>
